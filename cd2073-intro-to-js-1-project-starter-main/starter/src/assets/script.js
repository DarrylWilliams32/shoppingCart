/* Create an array named products which you will use to add all of your product object literals that you create in the next step. */

/* Create 3 or more product objects using object literal notation 
   Each product should include five properties
   - name: name of product (string)
   - price: price of product (number)

   - productId: unique id for the product (number)

/* Declare an empty array named cart to hold the items in the cart */

/* Create a function named addProductToCart that takes in the product productId as an argument
  - addProductToCart should get the correct product based on the productId
  - addProductToCart should then increase the product's quantity

  - decreaseQuantity should get the correct product based on the productId
  - decreaseQuantity should decrease the quantity of the product
  - if the function decreases the quantity to 0, the product is removed from the cart

/* Create a function named cartTotal that has no parameters
  - cartTotal should iterate through the cart to get the total cost of all products
  - cartTotal should return the total cost of the products in the cart
  Hint: price and quantity can be used to determine total cost

/* Create a function called emptyCart that empties the products from the cart */

/* Create a function named pay that takes in an amount as an argument
  - amount is the money paid by customer
  - pay will return a negative number if there is a remaining balance
  - pay will return a positive number if money should be returned to customer
  Hint: cartTotal function gives us cost of all the products in the cart
